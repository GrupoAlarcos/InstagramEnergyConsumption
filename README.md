## Abstract
(1) Background: The internet’s widespread use has made social media platforms (SMPs) an integral part of everyday life, transforming global communication and information sharing. Instagram, one of the leading SMPs, has 500 million daily users and offers various functionalities, such as stories and posts. However, the environmental impact of using these platforms remains largely unexplored.
(2) Methods: Using the FEETINGS framework, this paper investigates the energy consumption of Instagram by conducting measurement studies of various functionalities on both tablets and PCs.
(3) Results: The study found significant differences in energy consumption across different Instagram features. Sharing videos in stories and reels was identified as one of the most energy-intensive activities, and device choice was found to influence overall energy consumption, with PCs consuming more energy than tablets. 
(4) Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of optimising Instagram use for greater energy efficiency. Prioritising energy-efficient features and considering device choice can mitigate environmental impact and promote sustainable digital practices


## What is this?

This repository includes the resulting empirical results and some samples of the energy records obtained from the hardware measurement instrument used in the study.


## How is structured?

This folder contains three main folders: empirical results, resources and sample logs.


## Empirical Results Folder

The empirical results folder includes all the information on the analysis of the energy consumption of Instagram. The basic terminology used is as follows:
- An entity class corresponds to a Instagram. 
- The test case is each specific funcionality of Instagram.
- Measurement is each of the executions of a testcase.


### Reports Folder
The reports folder contains two folders (PC and Tablet).
Inside each of them are the Excel files with the energy consumption measurements, classified in each of the actions that have been measured.
In addition, there are also the box plot diagrams for each of the actions.
The structure of these folders is as follows:

```
Report folder |
              | PC | 
                   | Action 16
                   |
                   |
                   |
              | Tablet |   
                       |Posts |
                       |      | Action 1
                       |
                       | 
    
```


## Resources folder
This folder contains an example of Excel files with energy consumption data for each test case (Action).


## Sample Logs Folder
This folder contains an example of a log, to illustrate the raw data generated by the EET measurement instrument. 
- The json file contains the measurement information of the entity class.
- Each line of EXTERNAL SAMPLES are the values obtained for id, time, monitor and DUT
- Each line of INTERNAL SAMPLES are the values obtained for id, time, HDD(),HDD(2), Graphics card(1), Graphics card(2),Processor(1) and Processor(2).
DUT hardware components have two values because they have two sensors connected, the result of the DUT hardware component is the sum of the two values.

Note: The rest of the logs of this study are not included in the repository for practical reasons, due to their large size.

## Clustering Folder
This folder contains the results obtained in the clustering tests.
